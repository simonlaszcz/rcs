> This is a new build using the original unchanged sources, to overcome the 125
> byte command line limit of the original binaries.
> The m68k-atari-mint build of gcc has been used.
> However, binaries are much bigger than the originals as MINTlib is now used.
> The binaries also execute much more slowly.
> Consequently, I use the originals wherever possible. 
> The new binaries are prefixed with an underscore and are bundled with the
> originals. DIFF.TTP remains unchanged.
