This file contains some notes from my porting effort.  It corresponds to
RCS5AKP1, which is the first release of my port of RCS (Revision Control
System, not Resource Construction Set) version 5.  The date of the release
is Jan 30, 1991.

First and foremost, the sources here compile under GCC 1.37.1 using the
libraries from J.Bammi (bammi@cadence.com).  Your mileage may vary.  You
will, at least, need to set ANSI_INCLUDES to zero to compile under a non-
ANSI compiler.

The file conf.h is a copy of conf.st, derived from conf.heg.  The original
needed a lot of work.  Study it.  The options in makefile are mostly used to
create conf.h from conf.sh, but since you create conf.h from conf.st (by
copying it) you don't need to worry about most of them.

I added some variables to conf.st.  The idea is that if you set them all to
zero, you get EXACTLY the original code for the whole package.  You still
get my name in the usage message, because the sources themselves are
different.

The variables I added are:

VARIABLE NAME                           MEANING WHEN NONZERO

DONT_USE_SIGNALS        Blows away all signal handling. Bammi's libs have
                        some signal facilities, but I don't trust them.

DONT_USE_FORK           Use system() instead.  See below about system().

DONT_USE_MAIL           Just tell the guy he's breaking a lock rather than
                        sending mail to the lock holder.

ANSI_INCLUDE_FILES      Don't redeclare stuff that should come from ANSI
                        include files.  This is actually more sweeping than
                        that: check your compiler's warning output for
                        things that are undeclared or redeclared.

USE_AKP_PAIRS           Use my 12345678.123 filename code.

HEAD_REV                Add the special name "head" as a rev name.

bad_unlink              Tells the code that unlink(A) fails if A is R/O.

terrible_rename         Tells the code that rename(A,B) fails if A is R/O.

AKP_MODES               Define WORKMODE as this lib needs it, not UNIX style.

AKP_BUGFIXES            Enables a couple of fixes for bugs I caught.

I also added has_tmpnam; this is used in the code but wasn't present in 
conf.heg.

Grepping through the source files for each of these names will show you
what I had to do for the port.  If you define them all to zero (or leave
them undefined) you should get EXACTLY what was in the distribution,
and you can start your own porting effort!

I added .ttp to all the executables in the makefile, and commented out
things like merge.

rcsbase and conf.h together have declarations and prototypes for stuff
that should come from include files if you actually have ANSI and POSIX
includes.  Your library and include files may vary from mine.

There's a serious set of bugs involving errno in rcsfnms.c: basically they
assume it stays unchanged, or gets set to zero, through a successful
library call.  This is contrary to both ANSI and POSIX.  I have fixed this
as best I can, but I may not have gotten it right.

ABOUT SYSTEM():

The system() call that comes with Bammi's libs seems unnecessarily complex;
it actually does something akin to a fork()/exec() when all it really has
to do is spawn().  I replaced it with something that does spawn().  It also
calls _unx2dos on the redirected input and output file names, which Bammi's
system() didn't do, so system("diff a b >m:/diffout") wouldn't work.  My
system.c is in the sources directory and used in the makefile.
