NAME
     rcsfreeze - freeze a configuration of sources checked in
     under RCS

SYNOPSIS
     rcsfreeze [_n_a_m_e]

DESCRIPTION
     rcsfreeze assigns a symbolic revision number to a set of RCS
     files that form a valid configuration.

     The idea is to run rcsfreeze each time a new version is
     checked in.  A unique symbolic name (C__n_u_m_b_e_r, where _n_u_m_b_e_r
     is increased each time rcsfreeze is run) is then assigned to
     the most recent revision of each RCS file of the main trunk.

     An optional _n_a_m_e argument to rcsfreeze gives a symbolic name
     to the configuration.  The unique identifier is still gen-
     erated and is listed in the log file but it will not appear
     as part of the symbolic revision name in the actual RCS
     files.

     A log message is requested from the user for future refer-
     ence.

     The shell script works only on all RCS files at one time.
     All changed files must be checked in already.  Run
     _r_c_s_c_l_e_a_n(1) first and see whether any sources remain in the
     current directory.

FILES
     RCS/.rcsfreeze.ver
          version number

     RCS/.rcsfreeze.log
          log messages, most recent first

BUGS
     rcsfreeze does not check whether any sources are checked out
     and modified.

     Although both source file names and RCS file names are
     accepted, they are not paired as usual with RCS commands.

     Error checking is rudimentary.

     rcsfreeze is just an optional example shell script, and
     should not be taken too seriously.  See CVS for a more com-
     plete solution.
