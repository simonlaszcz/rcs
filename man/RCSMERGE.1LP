NAME
     rcsmerge - merge RCS revisions

SYNOPSIS
     rcsmerge [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] _f_i_l_e

DESCRIPTION
     rcsmerge incorporates the changes between two revisions of
     an RCS file into the corresponding working file.

     A file name ending in ,v is an RCS file name, otherwise a
     working file name.  rcsmerge derives the working file name
     from the RCS file name and vice versa, as explained in
     co(1).  A pair consisting of both an RCS and a working file
     name may also be specified.

     At least one revision must be specified with one of the
     options described below, usually -r.  At most two revisions
     may be specified.  If only one revision is specified, the
     latest is omitted, the latest revision on the default branch
     (normally the highest branch on the trunk) is assumed for
     the second revision.  Revisions may be specified numerically
     or symbolically.

     rcsmerge prints a warning if there are overlaps, and delim-
     its the overlapping regions as explained in co -j.  The com-
     mand is useful for incorporating changes into a checked-out
     revision.

OPTIONS
     -k_s_u_b_s_t
          Use _s_u_b_s_t style keyword substitution.  See co(1) for
          details.  For example, -kk -r1.1 -r1.2 ignores differ-
          ences in keyword values when merging the changes from
          1.1 to 1.2.

     -p[_r_e_v]
          Send the result to standard output instead of overwrit-
          ing the working file.

     -q[_r_e_v]
          Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.

     -r[_r_e_v]
          Merge with respect to revision _r_e_v.

     -V_n  Emulate RCS version _n.  See co(1) for details.

EXAMPLES
     Suppose you have released revision 2.8 of f.c.  Assume
     furthermore that after you complete an unreleased revision
     3.4, you receive updates to release 2.8 from someone else.

     To combine the updates to 2.8 and your changes between 2.8
     and 3.4, put the updates to 2.8 into file f.c and execute

         rcsmerge  -p  -r2.8  -r3.4  f.c  >f.merged.c

     Then examine f.merged.c.  Alternatively, if you want to save
     the updates to 2.8 in the RCS file, check them in as revi-
     sion 2.8.1.1 and execute co -j:

         ci  -r2.8.1.1  f.c
         co  -r3.4  -j2.8:2.8.1.1  f.c

     As another example, the following command undoes the changes
     between revision 2.4 and 2.8 in your currently checked out
     revision in f.c.

         rcsmerge  -r2.8  -r2.4  f.c

     Note the order of the arguments, and that f.c will be
     overwritten.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Exit status is 0 for no overlaps, 1 for some overlaps, 2 for
     trouble.
