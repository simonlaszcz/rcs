NAME
     rcsdiff - compare RCS revisions

SYNOPSIS
     rcsdiff [ -k_s_u_b_s_t ] [ -q ] [ -r_r_e_v_1 [ -r_r_e_v_2 ] ] [ -V_n ] [
     _d_i_f_f _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] _f_i_l_e ...

DESCRIPTION
     rcsdiff runs diff(1) to compare two revisions of each RCS
     file given.  A file name ending in ,v is an RCS file name,
     otherwise a working file name.  rcsdiff derives the working
     file name from the RCS file name and vice versa, as
     explained in co(1).  Pairs consisting of both an RCS and a
     working file name may also be specified.

     The option -q suppresses diagnostic output.  Zero, one, or
     two revisions may be specified with -r.  The option -k_s_u_b_s_t
     affects keyword substitution when extracting revisions, as
     described in co(1); for example, -kk -r1.1 -r1.2 ignores
     differences in keyword values when comparing revisions 1.1
     and 1.2.  To avoid excess output from locker name substitu-
     tion, -kkvl is assumed if (1) at most one revision option is
     given, (2) no -k option is given, (3) -kkv is the default
     keyword substitution, and (4) the working file's mode would
     be produced by co -l.  See co(1) for details about -V.  Oth-
     erwise, all options of diff(1) that apply to regular files
     are accepted, with the same meaning as for diff.

     If both _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 are omitted, rcsdiff compares the
     latest revision on the default branch (by default the trunk)
     with the contents of the corresponding working file.  This
     is useful for determining what you changed since the last
     checkin.

     If _r_e_v_1 is given, but _r_e_v_2 is omitted, rcsdiff compares
     revision _r_e_v_1 of the RCS file with the contents of the
     corresponding working file.

     If both _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 are given, rcsdiff compares revisions
     _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 of the RCS file.

     Both _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 may be given numerically or symbolically.

EXAMPLE
     The command

             rcsdiff  f.c

     compares the latest revision on the default branch of the
     RCS file RCS/f.c,v to the contents of the working file f.c.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Exit status is 0 for no differences during any comparison, 1
     for some differences, 2 for trouble.
