NAME
     merge - three-way file merge

SYNOPSIS
     merge [ -L _l_a_b_e_l_1 [ -L _l_a_b_e_l_3 ] ] [ -p ] [ -q ] _f_i_l_e_1 _f_i_l_e_2
     _f_i_l_e_3

DESCRIPTION
     merge incorporates all changes that lead from _f_i_l_e_2 to _f_i_l_e_3
     into _f_i_l_e_1.  The result goes to standard output if -p is
     present, into _f_i_l_e_1 otherwise.  merge is useful for combin-
     ing separate changes to an original.  Suppose _f_i_l_e_2 is the
     original, and both _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_3 are modifications of
     _f_i_l_e_2.  Then merge combines both changes.

     An overlap occurs if both _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_3 have changes in a
     common segment of lines.  merge outputs a message if over-
     laps occurred, and includes both alternatives in the result.
     The alternatives are delimited as follows:

          <<<<<<< _f_i_l_e_1
          _l_i_n_e_s _i_n _f_i_l_e_1
          =======
          _l_i_n_e_s _i_n _f_i_l_e_3
          >>>>>>> _f_i_l_e_3

     If there are overlaps, the user should edit the result and
     delete one of the alternatives.  If the -L _l_a_b_e_l_1 and
     -L _l_a_b_e_l_3 options are given, the labels are output in place
     of the names _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_3 in overlap reports.  Any over-
     lap message is suppressed if the -q option is given.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Exit status is 0 for no overlaps, 1 for some overlaps, 2 for
     trouble.
