NAME
     rcsfile - format of RCS file

DESCRIPTION
     An RCS file's contents are described by the grammar below.
     The text is free format: space, backspace, tab, newline,
     vertical tab, form feed, and carriage return (collectively,
     _w_h_i_t_e _s_p_a_c_e) have no significance except in strings.
     Strings are enclosed by @.  If a string contains a @, it
     must be doubled; otherwise, strings may contain arbitrary
     binary data.

     The meta syntax uses the following conventions: `|' (bar)
     separates alternatives; `{' and `}' enclose optional
     phrases; `{' and `}*' enclose phrases that may be repeated
     zero or more times; `{' and '}+' enclose phrases that must
     appear at least once and may be repeated; Terminal symbols
     are in boldface; nonterminal symbols are in _i_t_a_l_i_c_s.

     Identifiers are case sensitive.  Keywords are in lower case
     only.  The sets of keywords and identifiers may overlap.  In
     most environments RCS uses the ISO 8859/1 encoding: letters
     are octal codes 101-132, 141-172, 300-326, 330-366 and 370-
     377, visible graphic characters are codes 041-176 and
     240-377, and white space characters are codes 010-015 and
     040.

     The _n_e_w_p_h_r_a_s_e productions in the grammar are reserved for
     future extensions to the format of RCS files.  No _n_e_w_p_h_r_a_s_e
     will begin with any keyword already in use.

     The _d_e_l_t_a nodes form a tree.  All nodes whose numbers con-
     sist of a single pair (e.g., 2.3, 2.1, 1.3, etc.) are on the
     trunk, and are linked through the next field in order of
     decreasing numbers.  The head field in the _a_d_m_i_n node points
     to the head of that sequence (i.e., contains the highest
     pair).  The branch node in the admin node indicates the
     default branch (or revision) for most RCS operations.  If
     empty, the default branch is the highest branch on the
     trunk.

     All _d_e_l_t_a nodes whose numbers consist of 2_n fields (_n)
     (e.g., 3.1.1.1, 2.1.2.2, etc.) are linked as follows.  All
     nodes whose first 2_n-1 number fields are identical are
     linked through the next field in order of increasing
     numbers.  For each such sequence, the _d_e_l_t_a node whose
     number is identical to the first 2_n-2 number fields of the
     deltas on that sequence is called the branchpoint.  The
     branches field of a node contains a list of the numbers of
     the first nodes of all sequences for which it is a bran-
     chpoint.  This list is ordered in increasing numbers.
