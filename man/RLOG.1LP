NAME
     rlog - print log messages and other information about RCS
     files

SYNOPSIS
     rlog [ _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] _f_i_l_e ...

DESCRIPTION
     rlog prints information about RCS files.  File names ending
     in ,v denote RCS files; all others denote working files.  If
     a working file is given, rlog tries to find the correspond-
     ing RCS file first in an RCS subdirectory and then in the
     working file's directory, as explained in co(1).

     rlog prints the following information for each RCS file: RCS
     file name, working file name, head (i.e., the number of the
     latest revision on the trunk), default branch, access list,
     locks, symbolic names, suffix, total number of revisions,
     number of revisions selected for printing, and descriptive
     text.  This is followed by entries for the selected revi-
     sions in reverse chronological order for each branch.  For
     each revision, rlog prints revision number, author,
     date/time, state, number of lines added/deleted (with
     respect to the previous revision), locker of the revision
     (if any), and log message.  All times are displayed in GMT.
     Without options, rlog prints complete information.  The
     options below restrict this output.

     -L  Ignore RCS files that have no locks set.  This is con-
         venient in combination with -h, -l, and -R.

     -R  Print only the name of the RCS file.  This is convenient
         for translating a working file name into an RCS file
         name.

     -h  Print only the RCS file name, working file name, head,
         default branch, access list, locks, symbolic names, and
         suffix.

     -t  Print the same as -h, plus the descriptive text.

     -b  Print information about the revisions on the default
         branch, normally the highest branch on the trunk.

     -d_d_a_t_e_s
         Print information about revisions with a checkin
         date/time in the ranges given by the semicolon-separated
         list of _d_a_t_e_s.  A range of the form _d_1<_d_2 or _d_2>_d_1
         selects the revisions that were deposited between _d_1 and
         _d_2 inclusive.  A range of the form <_d or _d> selects all
         revisions dated _d or earlier.  A range of the form _d< or
         >_d selects all revisions dated _d or later.  A range of

         the form _d selects the single, latest revision dated _d
         or earlier.  The date/time strings _d, _d_1, and _d_2 are in
         the free format explained in co(1).  Quoting is normally
         necessary, especially for < and >.  Note that the
         separator is a semicolon.

     -l[_l_o_c_k_e_r_s]
         Print information about locked revisions only.  In addi-
         tion, if the comma-separated list _l_o_c_k_e_r_s of login names
         is given, ignore all locks other than those held by the
         _l_o_c_k_e_r_s.  For example, rlog -L -R -lwft RCS/*,v prints
         the name of RCS files locked by the user wft.

     -r_r_e_v_i_s_i_o_n_s
         prints information about revisions given in the comma-
         separated list _r_e_v_i_s_i_o_n_s of revisions and ranges.  A
         range _r_e_v_1-_r_e_v_2 means revisions _r_e_v_1 to _r_e_v_2 on the same
         branch, -_r_e_v means revisions from the beginning of the
         branch up to and including _r_e_v, and _r_e_v- means revisions
         starting with _r_e_v to the end of the branch containing
         _r_e_v.  An argument that is a branch means all revisions
         on that branch.  A range of branches means all revisions
         on the branches in that range.

     -s_s_t_a_t_e_s
         prints information about revisions whose state attri-
         butes match one of the states given in the comma-
         separated list _s_t_a_t_e_s.

     -w[_l_o_g_i_n_s]
         prints information about revisions checked in by users
         with login names appearing in the comma-separated list
         _l_o_g_i_n_s.  If _l_o_g_i_n_s is omitted, the user's login is
         assumed.

     -V_n Emulate RCS version _n when generating logs.  See co(1)
         for more.

     rlog prints the intersection of the revisions selected with
     the options -d, -l, -s, and -w, intersected with the union
     of the revisions selected by -b and -r.

EXAMPLES
         rlog  -L  -R  RCS/*,v
         rlog  -L  -h  RCS/*,v
         rlog  -L  -l  RCS/*,v
         rlog  RCS/*,v

     The first command prints the names of all RCS files in the
     subdirectory RCS that have locks.  The second command prints
     the headers of those files, and the third prints the headers
     plus the log messages of the locked revisions.  The last

DIAGNOSTICS
     The exit status is zero if and only if all operations were
     successful.
