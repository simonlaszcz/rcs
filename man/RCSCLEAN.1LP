NAME
     rcsclean - clean up working files

SYNOPSIS
     rcsclean [_r_c_s_d_i_f_f _o_p_t_i_o_n_s] [_f_i_l_e ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     rcsclean removes working files that were checked out and
     never modified.  For each file given, rcsclean compares the
     working file and a revision in the corresponding RCS file.
     If it finds no difference, it removes the working file, and,
     if the revision was locked, unlocks the revision.

     If no _f_i_l_e is given, all working files in the current direc-
     tory are cleaned.  Any other options are passed along to
     rcsdiff for the comparison.

     rcsclean is useful for clean targets in Makefiles.  See also
     rcsdiff(1), which prints out the differences, and ci(1),
     which normally asks whether to check in a file if it was not
     changed.

EXAMPLES
          rcsclean  *.c  *.h

     removes all working files ending in .c or .h that were not
     changed since their checkout.
          rcsclean

     removes all working files in the current directory that were
     not changed since their checkout.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The exit status is 0 if there were no differences in any
     file under RCS control, 1 if there were differences, and 2
     if there were errors.

     Any diagnostics generated by rcsdiff when comparing files
     are discarded.

     If the latest revision is already unlocked, and you have a
     lock on an earlier revision, the earlier revision is
     unlocked.

     rcsclean is just an optional example shell script, and
     should not be taken too seriously.
